          People sometimes say, “don’t judge a book by its cover” and even though we LOVE beautiful duvet covers at HomeChoice,
          what really matters when you’re looking for warm winter sleep is what’s inside the covers, not just what’s on top!

          The best thing about winter sheets
        </div>

        <div class="bedroom-basics-copy">
          What works for summer isn’t always best for the cold winter nights. Winter sheets feel warm against your skin as soon as
          you touch them, which means you don’t have to wait for them to heat up around your body before you fall asleep. They are
          also soft, fluffy and very comfortable. Traditionally, winter sheet sets are made from cotton flannel but HomeChoice also
          has them in even thicker, warmer polar fleece. You won’t find this anywhere else

            The warmest duvet inners

          <div class="bedroom-basics-copy">
            Natural duvets include all sorts of fillings from cotton to camel
            hair, wool to kapok, but undoubtedly the warmest ones available
            are made from feathers or down.

            The lowdown on down
          </div>

          <div class="bedroom-basics-copy">
            Down is what we call the smallest, finest feathers on a duck or
            goose. They’re often tightly curled so they trap air and insulate
            heat. When people speak about feather duvets, the feathers used
            are flatter, longer and harder than down. They trap air but not as
            easily and they’re a lot heavier on the body.

            In the past, feather and down duvets were as well known for their
            long-lasting quality, warmth and softness as for causing allergies.
            But today, they’re often treated against dust and other allergens
            so they can still be considered an option for allergy-sufferers.
            However, HomeChoice also stocks the Royal Danish Sheradown
            duvet inner – with a synthetic filler that feels just like real feathers
            and down. It’s completely hypoallergenic so it’s safer and j
            ust as luxurious.
