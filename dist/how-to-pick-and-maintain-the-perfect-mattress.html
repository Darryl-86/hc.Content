      <p>Choosing your ideal mattress is about more than pressing on the corner and hopping on the edge to “check the support”.</p>

      <p>First, you need to figure out what type of sleeper you are, so you can choose a mattress that will provide a comfortable and supportive base for a great night’s sleep.</p>  

      <p>Here are the three main types of sleeping positions — and the type of mattress 
      you need.</p>

        WHEN YOU SHOULD REPLACE YOUR MATTRESS

      <p>Generally, a good quality mattress should last between 8 – 10 years. It’s important to change your mattress so that your body can be properly supported and to ensure a comfortable night’s sleep.</p> 

      <p>If you answer yes to any of the following questions, it’s probably time to change your mattress:</p> 

      <ol>
        <li class="list-item">Are you frequently waking up feeling unrefreshed and aching?</li>
        <li class="list-item">Do you disturb your partner or are you disturbed by them when changing sleep positions?</li>
        <li class="list-item">Does it look used or worn?</li>
        <li class="list-item">Does it feel lumpy?</li>
        <li class="list-item">Have you recently had a better night’s sleep in a different bed?</li>

      <p>If you’re sharing a bed, your mattress and bed frame should be 10-20cm longer than the tallest user and wide enough for both of you to toss and turn without disturbing the other too much (but seriously, just get comfy already!)</p>

        CARING FOR YOUR MATTRESS
      </div>

      <p>
        While a good quality mattress should last you up to 10 years, you need to follow your mattress’s care guide to ensure maximum support, comfort and longevity.
      </p>  

      <p class="caring-for-your-mattress-last-para">
        Alternatively, here are some easy-to-follow tips to maintain your mattress:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="list-item">
          Before you use your new mattress, remove all packaging and place your mattress flat on the bed base without mattress protectors or bedding. This allows the mattress to air out and any scents from the fillings or packaging to 
          disperse. If your mattress contains memory foam or latex it may need a couple of days.
        </li>

        <li class="list-item">
          Daily airing is also recommended to allow moisture to evaporate. To do this, pull back the top sheets and duvet for 20 minutes.
        </li>

        <li class="list-item">
          Your bed base can affect how the mattress feels. If you’re using a slatted base we recommend no more than 6.5cm between each slat to ensure proper support.
        </li>

        <li class="list-item">No-Turn mattresses should be positioned with the label facing up.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Use a mattress protector to prolong the life of your mattress and provide an extra barrier from liquids and dust.</li>

        <li class="list-item">If moving your mattress, we recommend you keep it flat.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Each mattress feels different, so you’ll need to give yourself time to adjust to the new sensation, support and comfort.</li>

        <li class="list-item">All mattresses show some bodyshaping as the fillings settle with use. Pillow-top mattresses might show this more obviously, but this is normal and doesn’t affect the mattress performance.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Rotate your mattress once a month (turning top to tail) to limit the effect of filling settling from body pressure.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Liquids can cause damage and discolouration, so try to keep them away from your mattress.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Turn dual-sided mattresses once a month.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Vacuum the surface every 2 months to keep your mattress dust-free.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Do not stand or jump on your mattress.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Do not use detergent or chemical cleaners as this can stain, bleach and damage the material and fillings.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Try not to sit on the edge of the bed as this can strain the edges of your mattress and cause the border stitching to split or edges to collapse.</li>
