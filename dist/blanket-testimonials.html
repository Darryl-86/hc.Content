          I’m called a sleep expert here at HomeChoice, but truthfully, you can call yourself a sleep expert too. Why?
          Because you’ve spent a lot of time sleeping – up to a third of your life! This is why I always take customer feedback on our
          blankets seriously – and you should too if you’re thinking of buying one – because all the comments come from people who
          have spent time getting to know our blankets.

          The sleep experts in our Facebook community have a lot to say, and we’re always excited to read and learn from their
          experiences. Here are two of my favourite stories from customers who bought blankets from HomeChoice:

        I’ve collected 55 real customer comments about our blankets for you, and to make them fun to read, I’ve put all their
        important points into a word cloud.
      </div>

      <div class="header-sub-heading-text">
        The size of each word/sentence in the cloud shows how many customers said the exact same thing about our blankets.
        For example, most people thought it was important to mention how warm our blankets are, so the word ‘warm’
        is the biggest.
