        <p>
          <span>What is DebiCheck?</span>

          DebiCheck is a <strong>new secure debit order payment system</strong> through which your bank will ask you to <strong>approve your debit order amount</strong> – after you have set up your debit order with <strong>homechoice</strong>. This puts you in control and keeps your money safe! 
        </p>

        <div class="debi-list">
          <span>How will DebiCheck affect you?</span>

          DebiCheck will only affect you if you are one of these five types of customers:  

          <ol>
            <li>You set up a new debit order</li>
            <li>Your <strong>homechoice</strong> purchases exceed your current debit order repayment amount</li>
            <li>You cancel your debit order and then decide to reinstate it</li>
            <li>Your bank account details change</li>
            <li>Your debit order is cancelled after non-payment</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="debi-list">
          <span>How will DebiCheck work?</span>

          <ul>
            <li>If you are one of these five types of customers, you will receive a message from your bank to <strong>confirm that your debit order information</strong> is correct.</li>
            <li>This message will be sent to you via either your online banking app, USSD, SMS or email. You will be asked to confirm your debit order via your online banking app or at an ATM or your bank branch.</li>
            <li>Your bank will let you know how they are sending the DebiCheck confirmation, so it’s important that your contact details are up to date with your bank.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          <span>Why should I set up a DebiCheck debit order?</span>
          
          Paying by debit order is now even safer with DebiCheck as <strong>your account will be safe and protected</strong> from any unauthorised debit order amounts. It’s important to note that if you receive a DebiCheck confirmation and do not approve it, we will in some instances, be unable to process your order and you will need to place your order again.
        </p>  

        <p class="last-copy">
          <span>I want to pay my homechoice account with a DebiCheck debit order</span>

          Great! Call 0861 466 324 and confirm your details with us. Your bank will then ask you to confirm if your debit order details are correct.
        </p>
