          Let’s face it – nobody likes to clean. The quicker we can get it over with, the quicker we can get to the more important things
          in life. Here are a few tips for cleaning your home, inside and out, and a few ways to get the kids involved.

          1. Set a timer for 30 minutes and see how much you can get
          done in that time. You’ll be surprised how quickly you can
          work when you’re trying to beat the clock!

          3. Start your cleaning by spraying your bathtub/shower, sink and
          toilet so you can let the cleaner soak in and scrub less later
          on. Pop two denture-cleaning tablets in the toilet for an hour
          or so to remove difficult stains.

        <div class="quick-cleaning-tips-gen-copy">
          4. Tackle one room at a time, dusting, then vacuuming and
          mopping. This way, you’ll avoid having to do anything twice
          and it’s easier to stay focused.
