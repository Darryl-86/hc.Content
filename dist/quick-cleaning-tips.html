          Let’s face it – nobody likes to clean. The quicker we can get it over with, the quicker we can get to the more important things
          in life. Here are a few tips for cleaning your home, inside and out, and a few ways to get the kids involved.

        <div class="quick-cleaning-tips-gen-copy">
          1. Set a timer for 30 minutes and see how much you can get
          done in that time. You’ll be surprised how quickly you can
          work when you’re trying to beat the clock!

          child who wins a special treat at the end.
        </div>
        <div class="quick-cleaning-tips-gen-copy">
          3. Start your cleaning by spraying your bathtub/shower, sink and
          toilet so you can let the cleaner soak in and scrub less later
          on. Pop two denture-cleaning tablets in the toilet for an hour
          or so to remove difficult stains.
        </div>
        <div class="quick-cleaning-tips-gen-copy">
          4. Tackle one room at a time, dusting, then vacuuming and
          mopping. This way, you’ll avoid having to do anything twice
          and it’s easier to stay focused.
        </div>
        <div class="quick-cleaning-tips-gen-copy">
          5. A mop often just spreads dirt around on your floors. For the

        <div class="quick-cleaning-tips-gen-copy">

          clean, using it as a place to put things that belong in other rooms until you get to tackling those rooms.
        </div>
        <div class="quick-cleaning-tips-gen-copy-no-mb">
          7. End your cleaning with a relaxing bath or shower. Just remember to bring a sponge and clean the inside while you’re at it.

          makeup brushes, kitchen sponges and more! Just remember
          to put plastic items on the top shelf, wash delicate items
          on a lower temperature and wash dishes separately from
          household goods. I’d recommend the <a href="/midea-countertop-dishwasher" class="perfect-match">Midea countertop

          It absorbs smells and liquid and is quick to replace. If you’re
