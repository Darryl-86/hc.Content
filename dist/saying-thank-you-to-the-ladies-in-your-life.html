      The ladies in our lives take care of us in ways that we might not even think about. Our mothers, sisters, partners and female
      friends are always there for us when we need them. But it’s not always easy to tell them how much we appreciate who they
      are and what they do. That’s why I’ve put together some ways to say “thank you” that you might not have thought to try.

            <strong>Get up early and make a special breakfast.</strong> Who doesn’t
            love waking up to delicious smells coming from the kitchen?
            You could go all out and treat your loved ones to bacon,
            eggs, sausages and roast tomato, or you could stick to a
            simple breakfast of toast and coffee. What matters most
            is that it’s from the heart. <a href="/searchresults?Ntt=breakfast%20pack&Rdm=884&searchType=simple&type=search&Ns=&N=&Nrpp=12&No=0&Nr=AND(product.active:1,NOT(record.type:Store))" class="perfect-match">Browse HomeChoice breakfast

            <strong>Do the grocery shopping.</strong> Accompany your loved one when
            she goes to buy groceries. She’ll love it if you drive her there,
            push the trolley and carry heavy bags for her. You could even
            offer to go to the shops so she doesn’t have to.

            <strong>Offer to babysit.</strong> If you have a family member young enough
            to need babysitting, offer to take care of them for a few hours so that their caregiver can get some much-needed rest.
            Another good idea is to give your loved one a gift that makes caring for the baby a little bit easier. <a href="/searchresults?Ntt=baby&Rdm=540&searchType=simple&type=search&Ns=&N=&Nrpp=12&No=0&Nr=AND(product.active:1,NOT(record.type:Store))" class="perfect-match">Browse HomeChoice

            <strong>Make dinner or order takeout.</strong> If you aren’t the household cook, give your loved one a break by offering to make dinner or
            surprising her with takeout in the spur of the moment. You can turn it into a special occasion by laying the table with your
            best dinnerware (even if you’re only eating KFC). <a href="/searchresults?Ntt=dinnerware&Rdm=957&searchType=simple&type=search&Ns=&N=&Nrpp=12&No=0&Nr=AND(product.active:1,NOT(record.type:Store))" class="perfect-match">Browse HomeChoice dinnerware</a>.

            Two sets of hands make almost any job quicker and more
