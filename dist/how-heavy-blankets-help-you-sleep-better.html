          When people ask me why we talk about the weight of our
          <strong>homeChoice</strong> blankets, the reason is that the weight of
          a blanket suggests how warm it is by giving an indication of how thick
          or dense it is. The weight of a blanket also relates to its level of
          comfort – but this is different for everyone. Did you know that there
          are actually therapeutic reasons for using a heavy blanket? Let me
          explain.

            <h1>Some healthy pressure</h1>

            <p>
              The comfortable pressure you feel on your body when sleeping under
              a heavy blanket is similar to a technique occupational therapists
              use called ‘deep pressure stimulation’. Like a massage, it is
              strategically pushing, squeezing or holding the body to relieve
              pain or make a person calm. When done correctly, the technique
              reduces levels of cortisol (our main stress hormone), and releases
              serotonin (our happiness hormone).
            </p>

            <p>
              A study using specially weighted blankets reports that the heavy
              weight produced “feelings of safety, relaxation and comfort” for
              the people who participated in the study<sup>1</sup>. Another
              study used weighted vests on restless children, concluding that
              the extra weight helped them to stay calm and focus more on their
              schoolwork<sup>2</sup>. Studies have even found the use of
              weighted blankets and vests to relieve the symptoms of anxiety and
              insomnia<sup>3</sup>.

          The soothing effect of extra weight is ideal for helping people to
          fall asleep quickly. The weight also helps with tossing and turning
          for better quality of sleep without periods of wakefulness. There is
          even evidence to suggest that people with restless leg syndrome or
          chronic pain can find better sleep just by using the gentle pressure
          of a heavy blanket.

              Experts say that a heavy blanket is safe to use as long as you can
              move around underneath it. For the best effect, it should be
              around 10% of the user’s bodyweight. I don’t recommend heavy
              blankets for children under the age of 2 or for anyone who
              struggles with breathing issues like sleep apnea.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, if you could use some de-stressing in front of the TV or
              a better night’s sleep at the end of a long day, I highly
              recommend a heavy blanket for you!
