            It might seem like a silly task when you think of the busy day ahead, but making your bed can actually have a <strong>big impact</strong>
            on the rest of your day and the way you sleep at night. Let me tell you why.

                Your bed plays such a big part in your life that you owe it to
                yourself to make your bedroom <strong>your sanctuary</strong> – a place that’s
                <strong>relaxing, calm and comfortable</strong> (Click to find out <a class="perfect-match" href="/how-to-create-a-sleep-sanctuary">how to make your own sleep sanctuary</a>). The problem is that even after doing
                this, your bedroom can easily become neglected, untidy and
                cluttered, turning back into just being the place you crash at night
                and rush out of in the morning. Don’t worry – you can keep your
                bedroom the restful retreat that <strong>heals your body and your mind</strong>
                by just <strong>making your bed</strong>.

                A messy bedroom isn’t inspiring – it’s actually tiring. When you
                are busy making your bed, you are also refreshing your mind

                Making your bed every day is a good habit that has a domino
                effect. When you’re organised in one small part of your life, you’ll find you are inspired to organise other parts of your life
                that you haven’t had the time or energy to manage before.
