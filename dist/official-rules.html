                                1. The promoter is <strong>homechoice</strong> (Pty) Ltd (&quot;the Promoter&quot;).<br />
                                2. The promotional competition is open to all customers whose accounts are in good standing, who are
                                South African residents, or residents of Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Zambia and Lesotho, who are
                                in possession of a valid identity document, except any director, member, partner, employee, agent or
                                consultant of the Promoter, the marketing service providers or any person who directly or indirectly
                                controls or is controlled by these entities, including their spouses, life partners, business
                                partners or immediate family members.<br />
                                3. All participants indemnify the company against any and all claims of any nature whatsoever
                                arising out of and/or from their participation in this competition. The company is not liable for
                                any defect in the prizes. The company reserves the right to substitute prizes with any other prize
                                of comparable commercial value.<br />
                                4. Entries that are unclear, illegible or contain errors will be declared invalid.<br />
                                5. The company will use reasonable efforts to contact grand prize winners during working hours
                                (between 8am and 5pm) either telephonically or via e-mail on the contact number or e-mail address as
                                provided by the winners. <strong>homechoice</strong> will endeavour to contact the potential prize
                                winner within two weeks from draw date.<br />
                                6. The potential prize winner may be required to provide or verify their name, surname, ID number,
                                telephone number and physical address with a <strong>homechoice</strong> representative. The
                                potential prize winner is not an actual winner until his / her submission is validated and satisfies
                                the qualifying criterion set by the promoter. If a potential prize winner does not meet the
                                eligibility requirements, the prize will be forfeited.<br />
                                7. If the company is unable to reach any person after drawing his/her entry for whatsoever reason,
                                such person will be disqualified and the draw of a replacement entry shall take place in the same
                                manner as the first draw.<br />
                                8. The Promoter shall not be responsible for any lost, damaged or delayed entries for any reason
                                whatsoever. Proof of sending will not be accepted as proof of receipt.<br />
                                9. The Promoter reserves the right to disqualify any claim if fraud or cheating is suspected,
                                including without limitation, through the manipulation of code or otherwise falsifying data.<br />
                                10. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Any attempt to use multiple e-mail accounts or other tactics to enter
                                more than the stated limit may result in disqualification and all associated entries will be void.
                                Entries generated by script, macro, bot, commercial contest subscription, incentives or other means
                                not sponsored by the Promoter, entering service sites or any other automated means and entries by
                                any means that subvert the entry process or do not conform to the terms or spirit of these
                                competition rules, will void the entry and may disqualify the entrant.<br />
                                11. The company may require winners to complete an information disclosure document and/or
                                indemnification to ensure compliance with these rules and the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008.
                                Should any winner refuse or be unable to comply, such winner will be deemed to have rejected the
                                prize.<br />
                                12. The company may require winners be identified and/or photographed and the photographs published
                                in printed or electronic media. The winners will be given the opportunity to decline to the
                                publication of their images and to participate in marketing material in so far as it relates to the
                                competition.<br />
                                13. The Promoter shall have the right to change or terminate the promotional competition and without
                                notice, for any reason which the Promoter reasonably deems necessary.<br />
                                14. In the event of such change or termination, all participants agree to waive any rights that they
                                have in respect of this promotional competition and acknowledge that they will have no recourse
                                against the Promoter or its agents.<br />
                                15. Neither the Promoter, its agents, its associated companies, nor any directors, officers or
                                employees of such, shall be liable for any loss or damage, whether direct, indirect, consequential
                                or otherwise arising from any cause whatsoever, which may be suffered by the participant.<br />
                                16. Participation in the promotion constitutes acceptance of the promotional rules and participants
                                agree to abide by the rules, which will be interpreted by the company&rsquo;s appointed judges,
                                whose decision regarding any dispute will be final and binding.<br />
                                17. In the event that the prize is not available despite the Promoter&#39;s reasonable endeavours to
                                procure the prize, the Promoter reserves the right to substitute prizes of equal value.<br />
                                18. For prizes other than cash, unless it is specifically provided for and allowed in the marketing
                                material, the prize(s) are neither transferable nor redeemable for cash. Prizes are subject to
                                availability and the company may substitute prizes for alternative products or services of similar
                                value.<br />
                                19. The Promoter assumes no liability whatsoever for any entry that has been omitted from
                                participation for any reason whatsoever. The Promoter is not liable for any technical failures
                                affecting the participation and/or voucher redemption process of the promotion.<br />
                                20. The winners&rsquo; details (name and home town only) will be available after the draw date, on
