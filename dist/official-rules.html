                                whatsoever
                                arising out of and/or from their participation in this competition. The company is not
                                liable for
                                any defect in the prizes. The company reserves the right to substitute prizes with any
                                other prize
                                of comparable commercial value.<br />
                                4. Entries that are unclear, illegible or contain errors will be declared invalid.<br />
                                5. The company will use reasonable efforts to contact grand prize winners during working

                                provided by the winners. <strong>homechoice</strong> will endeavour to contact the
                                potential prize
                                winner within two weeks from draw date.<br />
                                6. The potential prize winner may be required to provide or verify their name, surname,
                                ID number,

                                The
                                potential prize winner is not an actual winner until his / her submission is validated
                                and satisfies
                                the qualifying criterion set by the promoter. If a potential prize winner does not meet
                                the

                                7. If the company is unable to reach any person after drawing his/her entry for
                                whatsoever reason,

                                8. The Promoter shall not be responsible for any lost, damaged or delayed entries for
                                any reason
                                whatsoever. Proof of sending will not be accepted as proof of receipt.<br />
                                9. The Promoter reserves the right to disqualify any claim if fraud or cheating is
                                suspected,

                                data.<br />
                                10. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Any attempt to use multiple e-mail accounts or other tactics

                                will be void.
                                Entries generated by script, macro, bot, commercial contest subscription, incentives or
                                other means
                                not sponsored by the Promoter, entering service sites or any other automated means and
                                entries by

                                and/or
                                indemnification to ensure compliance with these rules and the Consumer Protection Act 68
                                of 2008.
                                Should any winner refuse or be unable to comply, such winner will be deemed to have
                                rejected the
                                prize.<br />
                                12. The company may require winners be identified and/or photographed and the
                                photographs published
                                in printed or electronic media. The winners will be given the opportunity to decline to
                                the
                                publication of their images and to participate in marketing material in so far as it
                                relates to the
                                competition.<br />
                                13. The Promoter shall have the right to change or terminate the promotional competition
                                and without

                                14. In the event of such change or termination, all participants agree to waive any
                                rights that they
                                have in respect of this promotional competition and acknowledge that they will have no
                                recourse
                                against the Promoter or its agents.<br />
                                15. Neither the Promoter, its agents, its associated companies, nor any directors,
                                officers or
                                employees of such, shall be liable for any loss or damage, whether direct, indirect,
                                consequential
                                or otherwise arising from any cause whatsoever, which may be suffered by the
                                participant.<br />
                                16. Participation in the promotion constitutes acceptance of the promotional rules and
                                participants
                                agree to abide by the rules, which will be interpreted by the company&rsquo;s appointed
                                judges,
                                whose decision regarding any dispute will be final and binding.<br />
                                17. In the event that the prize is not available despite the Promoter&#39;s reasonable
                                endeavours to
                                procure the prize, the Promoter reserves the right to substitute prizes of equal
                                value.<br />
                                18. For prizes other than cash, unless it is specifically provided for and allowed in
                                the marketing
                                material, the prize(s) are neither transferable nor redeemable for cash. Prizes are

                                of similar
                                value.<br />
                                19. The Promoter assumes no liability whatsoever for any entry that has been omitted
                                from
                                participation for any reason whatsoever. The Promoter is not liable for any technical
                                failures
                                affecting the participation and/or voucher redemption process of the promotion.<br />
                                20. The winners&rsquo; details (name and home town only) will be available after the
