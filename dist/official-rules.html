                  STANDARD RULES FOR HOMECHOICE COMPETITIONS
                </div>
                <div class="standard-rules-content">
                  1. The promoter is <strong>homechoice</strong> (Pty) Ltd
                  (&quot;the Promoter&quot;).<br />
                  2. The promotional competition is open to all customers whose
                  accounts are in good standing, who are South African
                  residents, or residents of Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland,
                  Zambia and Lesotho, who are in possession of a valid identity
                  document, except any director, member, partner, employee,
                  agent or consultant of the Promoter, the marketing service
                  providers or any person who directly or indirectly controls or
                  is controlled by these entities, including their spouses, life
                  partners, business partners or immediate family members.<br />
                  3. All participants indemnify the company against any and all
                  claims of any nature whatsoever arising out of and/or from
                  their participation in this competition. The company is not
                  liable for any defect in the prizes. The company reserves the
                  right to substitute prizes with any other prize of comparable
                  commercial value.<br />
                  4. Entries that are unclear, illegible or contain errors will
                  be declared invalid.<br />
                  5. The company will use reasonable efforts to contact grand
                  prize winners during working hours (between 8am and 5pm)
                  either telephonically or via e-mail on the contact number or
                  e-mail address as provided by the winners.
                  <strong>homechoice</strong> will endeavour to contact the
                  potential prize winner within two weeks from draw date.<br />
                  6. The potential prize winner may be required to provide or
                  verify their name, surname, ID number, telephone number and
                  physical address with a
                  <strong>homechoice</strong> representative. The potential
                  prize winner is not an actual winner until his / her
                  submission is validated and satisfies the qualifying criterion
                  set by the promoter. If a potential prize winner does not meet
                  the eligibility requirements, the prize will be forfeited.<br />
                  7. If the company is unable to reach any person after drawing
                  his/her entry for whatsoever reason, such person will be
                  disqualified and the draw of a replacement entry shall take
                  place in the same manner as the first draw.<br />
                  8. The Promoter shall not be responsible for any lost, damaged
                  or delayed entries for any reason whatsoever. Proof of sending
                  will not be accepted as proof of receipt.<br />
                  9. The Promoter reserves the right to disqualify any claim if
                  fraud or cheating is suspected, including without limitation,
                  through the manipulation of code or otherwise falsifying
                  data.<br />
                  10. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Any attempt to use multiple e-mail
                  accounts or other tactics to enter more than the stated limit
                  may result in disqualification and all associated entries will
                  be void. Entries generated by script, macro, bot, commercial
                  contest subscription, incentives or other means not sponsored
                  by the Promoter, entering service sites or any other automated
                  means and entries by any means that subvert the entry process
                  or do not conform to the terms or spirit of these competition
                  rules, will void the entry and may disqualify the entrant.<br />
                  11. The company may require winners to complete an information
                  disclosure document and/or indemnification to ensure
                  compliance with these rules and the Consumer Protection Act 68
                  of 2008. Should any winner refuse or be unable to comply, such
                  winner will be deemed to have rejected the prize.<br />
                  12. The company may require winners be identified and/or
                  photographed and the photographs published in printed or
                  electronic media. The winners will be given the opportunity to
                  decline to the publication of their images and to participate
                  in marketing material in so far as it relates to the
                  competition.<br />
                  13. The Promoter shall have the right to change or terminate
                  the promotional competition and without notice, for any reason
                  which the Promoter reasonably deems necessary.<br />
                  14. In the event of such change or termination, all
                  participants agree to waive any rights that they have in
                  respect of this promotional competition and acknowledge that
                  they will have no recourse against the Promoter or its
                  agents.<br />
                  15. Neither the Promoter, its agents, its associated
                  companies, nor any directors, officers or employees of such,
                  shall be liable for any loss or damage, whether direct,
                  indirect, consequential or otherwise arising from any cause
                  whatsoever, which may be suffered by the participant.<br />
                  16. Participation in the promotion constitutes acceptance of
                  the promotional rules and participants agree to abide by the
                  rules, which will be interpreted by the company&rsquo;s
                  appointed judges, whose decision regarding any dispute will be
                  final and binding.<br />
                  17. In the event that the prize is not available despite the
                  Promoter&#39;s reasonable endeavours to procure the prize, the
                  Promoter reserves the right to substitute prizes of equal
                  value.<br />
                  18. For prizes other than cash, unless it is specifically
                  provided for and allowed in the marketing material, the
                  prize(s) are neither transferable nor redeemable for cash.
                  Prizes are subject to availability and the company may
                  substitute prizes for alternative products or services of
                  similar value.<br />
                  19. The Promoter assumes no liability whatsoever for any entry
                  that has been omitted from participation for any reason
                  whatsoever. The Promoter is not liable for any technical
                  failures affecting the participation and/or voucher redemption
                  process of the promotion.<br />
                  20. The winners&rsquo; details (name and home town only) will
                  be available after the draw date, on receipt of a stamped,
                  self-addressed envelope. Write to The Prize Draw

                  Winners may refuse to have their photos shown.<br />

                          Before you start your design, it is important to know
                          the difference between a jacquard woven design and a
                          printed design. A jacquard design is woven into the
                          blanket itself as it is produced on a loom. A printed
                          design is applied to the surface of the blanket after
                          the fabric has been produced.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-alpha">
                          Because of this fundamental difference in the
                          production process, your use of colour is also quite
                          different. The weaving process limits the way you use
                          colour in your design. The maximum number of colours
                          you can use in a single design is 8. You can also only
                          have 2 colours working together at the same time. If
                          you look at any horizontal line running across the
                          design, there can only be 2 colours in that line.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-alpha">
                          The winning design may be simplified for manufacturing
                          purposes.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-alpha">
                          You need to submit your own original design(s), not
                          someone else’s design. Pictures or screenshot of other
                          designs are not allowed.
